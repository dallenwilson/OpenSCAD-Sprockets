# OpenSCAD-Sprockets

This is an OpenSCAD file to generate 3d-printable STL files of chain sprockets, based on various options supplied to the generating function.

Forked to github to share the changes I made to it, adding support to generate keyway and set-screw holes and some sanity checking on various hub-related clearances.

Do play around with various options and take a good, hard look at the renderings before printing anything; I use this exclusively for ANSI chain, but the original auther included support for bicycle and motorcycle sprockets. Any changes I've made have been tested exclusively with the ANSI sizes, and even then, only whatever size I happen to be working with while making the change.
